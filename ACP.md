# Git Commands
Git is an important part of daily programming (especially if you’re working with a team) and is widely used in the software industry.
There is 4 main command we learnt today :
1. Git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

2. Git add
When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won’t be included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations). We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit.

3. Git commit
This is maybe the most-used command of Git. Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).

4. Git push
After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.
